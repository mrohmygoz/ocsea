georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:51:35 PM): do you know the difference between a guy who is \"cut\" and one who is \"uncut?\"
er1ca_leah_cx (03/20/14 4:51:58 PM): no?
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:52:10 PM): ok...
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:52:21 PM): do you know what circumcision is?
er1ca_leah_cx (03/20/14 4:52:39 PM): oooh yea'
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:53:28 PM): ok so you know that they ususally cut the skin off the penis of baby boys just after they are born?
er1ca_leah_cx (03/20/14 4:53:50 PM): yea
er1ca_leah_cx (03/20/14 4:54:01 PM): I never seen one the other way tho
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:54:10 PM): well...I'm the other way
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:54:20 PM): I'm uncut...uncircumcised...
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:54:33 PM): I wanted to tell you that...I hope it's not a show stopper...
er1ca_leah_cx (03/20/14 4:54:53 PM): lol well I dont care
er1ca_leah_cx (03/20/14 4:55:01 PM): why does it feel different?
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:55:08 PM): well you might care...lol

georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:55:25 PM): most girls do after they experience it...
er1ca_leah_cx (03/20/14 4:55:45 PM): hehe o rly
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:55:51 PM): did you know that the united states is the only civilized country that still does that routinely to baby boys?
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:56:10 PM): I got lucky and I thank my parents every day for not having me cut
er1ca_leah_cx (03/20/14 4:56:18 PM): nope didnt kno that.. why do they even do it??
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:56:27 PM): excellent question...
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:56:32 PM): see there is your maturity again...
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:56:40 PM): there is NO medical reason to do it...
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:57:00 PM): but still today in the united states about 70% of baby boys are circumcised
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:57:10 PM): so why do a surgery that isn't needed
er1ca_leah_cx (03/20/14 4:57:17 PM): crazy
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:57:24 PM): and it's done without anesthesia
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:57:35 PM): they just strap the baby down and start cutting
er1ca_leah_cx (03/20/14 4:57:43 PM): OMG
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:57:47 PM): most of the time the baby goes into shock
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:58:02 PM): from the intensity of the pain
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:58:13 PM): and the nurse has to slap them to get them to start breathing
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:58:17 PM): it's barbaric
er1ca_leah_cx (03/20/14 4:58:24 PM): what the heck
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:58:30 PM): I'm not kidding
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:58:36 PM): I work in healthcare and I've seen several...
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:58:40 PM): it's unbelievable
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:58:44 PM): that we allow that to be done
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:59:16 PM): so you ask why do we do an unecessary surgery that tortures baby boys?
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:59:31 PM): the simple answer is....
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:59:35 PM): $$$$$$$$$$$
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:59:41 PM): so sad
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 4:59:58 PM): the doctors make a lot of money doing it...so they don't educate the parents about it
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:00:14 PM): and the parents just assume that it's just a little \"snip\" and no big deal
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:00:32 PM): and most of the time the dad is cut...so they don't question it
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:00:36 PM): are you there?
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:00:43 PM): or have I freaked you out?
er1ca_leah_cx (03/20/14 5:00:56 PM): lol Im here reading
er1ca_leah_cx (03/20/14 5:01:01 PM): sounds stupid
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:01:20 PM): I have developed a website to help educate new parents about the procedure
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:01:31 PM): and encourage them to consider NOT having their baby boy cut
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:01:38 PM):*link removed*
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:01:42 PM): if you are interested
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:01:48 PM): anyway
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:01:59 PM): I'm glad you are ok with it
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:02:11 PM): see...the skin is there for a purpose
er1ca_leah_cx (03/20/14 5:02:33 PM): kool
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:03:00 PM): and the skin is also better for the woman...most think it is much more stimulating
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:03:42 PM): see...during intercourse...the skin moves back and forth over the head of the penis during penetration and thrusting...and that movement is VERY arousing and stimulating for a woman....
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:04:07 PM): did you say you had performed oral sex a few times ?
er1ca_leah_cx (03/20/14 5:04:37 PM): yea I did a few times w my bf
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:04:46 PM): yeah...cool
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:04:57 PM): but you could probably see that there was no skin
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:05:00 PM): it had been cut off
georgiamike1968 (03/20/14 5:05:37 PM): you might enjoy something different...:\"&gt;
