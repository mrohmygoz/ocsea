Folks meet Warren. Warren left a US Army base and crossed state lines to molest me.

First let me set this up by saying that today PeeJ teamed up with Harry Hairston and his crew from NBC 10 Philadelphia. Harry is the reporter that interviewed Brain Graves when we exposed him in Detroit. Harry has since moved on to work for the network directly, and contacted us about doing a limited engagement Group Media Bust in Philadelphia.

Now back to Warren. Warren is a soldier in the US Army and stationed in Aberdeen, Maryland. Warren isn't the most graphic pervert, but the fact that he wears this countries uniform really pisses me off. Fortunately CID takes cases like this very seriously, and I'm sure Warren is going to become acquainted with the Uniform Code of Military Justice very soon.

Here the verifier called and talked to Warren for about 20 minutes. While on the phone Warren told her that he would be over sometime after 1:00PM on Monday. He also told her that he recently came back from Iraq and that he was on active duty in the US Army, and currently residing on an Army base.

Well folks Warren did show up and of course met Harry and the NBC 10 Philadelphia News crew. Harry had a long chat with Warren and completely broke the situation down for him.

I received several offlines from Warren once he got back on base. I didn't respond as I had other perverts to deal with, but I'll post them in followup.
