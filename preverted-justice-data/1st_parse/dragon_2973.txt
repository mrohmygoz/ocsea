Joe Public, meet Steven.  Steven, meet Joe Public.  Steven found me in a regional chat room.  He chatted with me, waffled a bit, backed out of one meet, and then showed up for another.  He really wanted this.  He really got confiment, probation and sex offender registration.  Exactly what he wanted, right?  

Sadly, Steven was also a member of the US Navy.  Stationed at Bangor, he was awaiting orders for his next stint on a submarine out in the middle of the ocean.  If my memory serves, those are two month stints away from just about everything.  Interestingly enough, he'll now have two months of JAIL, which I would imagine is much less fun than being on a submarine.  Steven does not reflect the entire US Navy or really any of our armed forces except for himself, in these actions.  Please keep that in mind as you read his disgusting logs.
