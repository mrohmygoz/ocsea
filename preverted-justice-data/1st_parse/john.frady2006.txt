Meet John!  John started his chat with me in a dubious enough way: by turning on his webcam and focusing it where we all know our featured individuals like to focus them.  He disappeared for awhile, and I thought he was gone.  Alas, he was not.  

When he returned to my IM box, he again turned on his webcam and gave 13 year old me a show.
