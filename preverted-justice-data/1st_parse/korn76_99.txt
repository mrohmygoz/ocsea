korn76_99 (09/21/08  8:38:51 PM): this bread is great for em too
madbunnyz (09/21/08  8:38:56 PM): cool
korn76_99 (09/21/08  8:39:07 PM): just a bit small than normal bread
korn76_99 (09/21/08  8:39:24 PM): and i can slice it as thick as i want
madbunnyz (09/21/08  8:39:54 PM): u like it thin or thick
korn76_99 (09/21/08  8:40:09 PM): about middle
madbunnyz (09/21/08  8:40:15 PM): lol
korn76_99 (09/21/08  8:40:35 PM): too thin gives me no dough in the middle of the bread to taste
korn76_99 (09/21/08  8:40:48 PM): too thick makes em harder to bite into
madbunnyz (09/21/08  8:40:53 PM): lol ya

madbunnyz (10/13/08 11:53:29 PM): k
korn76_99 (10/13/08 11:53:43 PM): Drowning Dream Meaning 

Psychological Meaning: Dreams of drowning or struggling in treacherous waters may represent your fear of being swallowed by forces hidden in the depths of your unconscious. You may be proceeding too quickly with your opening of the unconscious. It may be helpful to talk your problems and fears through with a friend. They may be able to throw you a lifeline and help you 'keep your head above water'. The dream also shows how you are being overwhelmed by your emotions. You may fear sinking financially or be drowning in your difficulties. Do you feel that, in waking life, you are being 'sucked into' something you would rather not be a part of? Pause for a while and make sure you have your 'feet firmly on solid ground' before you make any major decision. 


madbunnyz (10/13/08 11:55:13 PM): wow
korn76_99 (10/13/08 11:55:49 PM): so?

korn76_99 (10/15/08 11:32:19 PM): they tried to trade their starting quarterback as well
korn76_99 (10/15/08 11:32:27 PM): but no one wanted him
korn76_99 (10/15/08 11:32:36 PM): so the lions put him on injured reserve
korn76_99 (10/15/08 11:32:44 PM): which ended his season
