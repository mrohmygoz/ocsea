<u>Verifier's Notes:</u>

<i>On Saturday, November 25, 2005, a Perverted-Justice.com Contributor, known to me as Captain Morgan contacted me requesting that I call and verify a phone number given by a bust, known to Captain Morgan  as Jay. Captain Morgan gave me the phone number, and I dialed *67-763-3004133 at approximately 12:38pm PST. The call lasted approximately 1 minute 40 seconds. 

When a male answered the phone, I asked for Jay. He said it was him.  I said this is Sarah.  He said I sounded sexy.  I giggled and said thank you.  I said you sound nice and he said that he was nice.  I said good.  There was a few seconds of silence and then I asked what he was doing, he said sitting in his room.  He asked what I was doing and I said same.  He asked if I had any pets, I said no.  I asked if he had any pets and he said no, but his room mate had 3 cats.  (garbled a bit but I think he said they stayed upstairs though).  He asked how many minutes were left on my card, and I said I didn't know.. I wasn't paying attention, but that there should be enough.  I said I had charged my phone a little and it should be ok too.  I asked him again about the cats and said, I want a cat.  He asked if my dad would let me have one and I said no.  He said doesn't your dad like pets and I said that he had aller...., but in mid-sentence, hung up.

The man I spoke to, Jay,  had no accent and there were no background noises of any sort.  

I do hereby affirm, under penalty of perjury, the foregoing to be true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

<u>Verifier's Notes:</u>

<i>Per our conversation earlier, I phoned Jay at 763-300-7906 at 4:31 PST.  I said Jay, he said yeah and I said Hi it's Sarah.  He said 'Hey, what's going on\"?, I said not much, but I only have 2 minutes on my card, so talk fast.  He said OK, are we for sure for tomorrow and I said yeah for sure, but I'm nervous.  He said why and I said I dunno.  I asked are you nervous and he said yeah, a little.  Then we laughed.  He said did you get my message, and I said No, what was it.  He said that we would have to meet at 1:45pm, and I said oh.  He asked if it would be OK and I said yes I guess.  He asked if I would be on later and I said probably.  But not until really late, and he asked if I had to wait for my dad to go to sleep and I said Yes.  We talked about the time again, I said I had forgotten, did he say 1:30? and he said no, 1:45.  I said I'd write it down and see him tomorrow.  He said bye and I said I hope I see you on line later.  He said I would.
