Here's Tim.  Tim is the type that tries to put everything on the kid.  Those types creep me out just as much, if not more, than the overtly sexual ones.  Somewhere, inside his head, he justifies sleeping with a 14 year old, because he's not saying no!  EARTH TO TIM:  YOU ARE AN ADULT.  IT IS YOUR JOB TO SAY NO!
