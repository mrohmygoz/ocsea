geo_allino (07/26/09  6:04:55 PM): Unix would attack someone if I gave him the command.
kelliemariem@ymail.com (07/26/09  6:05:08 PM): so they train em for u before u even get him?
geo_allino (07/26/09  6:05:28 PM): Yea. that is why i am driving all the way to wisconson to get Astro.
geo_allino (07/26/09  6:05:35 PM): because he is fully trained.

geo_allino (07/26/09 11:31:14 PM): :)
kelliemariem@ymail.com (07/26/09 11:31:47 PM): wow
kelliemariem@ymail.com (07/26/09 11:32:09 PM): y do some girls seem like they always have guys?
kelliemariem@ymail.com (07/26/09 11:32:29 PM): all the time shes got a new bf
geo_allino (07/26/09 11:32:56 PM): well, to tell you the truth, she is probably easy to be with sexually, and because she 'puts out' guys wanna be with her.
kelliemariem@ymail.com (07/26/09 11:33:10 PM): o
geo_allino (07/26/09 11:33:58 PM): i mean do you understand what i am trying to say?
geo_allino (07/26/09 11:34:06 PM): and thats silly but the girl dont know it....
kelliemariem@ymail.com (07/26/09 11:34:26 PM): yea u mean guys like girls who know how
geo_allino (07/26/09 11:34:33 PM): a silly girl will have a lot of sex cause she thinks she can get guys, the she will end up getting pregnant, and then no one will want her
geo_allino (07/26/09 11:34:44 PM): yea know how or just do it.
geo_allino (07/26/09 11:36:05 PM): the trick is to be yourself and dont do anything like those other girls until you discuss it with your mother or someone you trust, and that you know you wont have a un-expected pregnacy.
kelliemariem@ymail.com (07/26/09 11:36:28 PM): omg hah
kelliemariem@ymail.com (07/26/09 11:36:49 PM): my mom would kill me if i asked
geo_allino (07/26/09 11:37:01 PM): well, then just ask me.
geo_allino (07/26/09 11:37:16 PM): the most important thing is not to allow a man to get you pregnant.
geo_allino (07/26/09 11:37:33 PM): and try to save yourself for a true love, not just give yourself to any guy that comes along
kelliemariem@ymail.com (07/26/09 11:37:46 PM): o
geo_allino (07/26/09 11:40:17 PM): does that make sense to you??
kelliemariem@ymail.com (07/26/09 11:40:26 PM): gues so
geo_allino (07/26/09 11:41:01 PM): what are you thinkin about?
kelliemariem@ymail.com (07/26/09 11:41:26 PM): all that
kelliemariem@ymail.com (07/26/09 11:42:08 PM): i had a freind who said he didnt first do it til hes like 24
kelliemariem@ymail.com (07/26/09 11:42:53 PM): thats forever
geo_allino (07/26/09 11:43:11 PM): trust me theres no rush
geo_allino (07/26/09 11:43:18 PM): do you desire sex right now in your life?
kelliemariem@ymail.com (07/26/09 11:43:33 PM): if it happens
geo_allino (07/26/09 11:44:04 PM): what i meant to say is do you get 'horney' alot? where you want to have sexual contact?
kelliemariem@ymail.com (07/26/09 11:44:23 PM): is that like butterflys?
geo_allino (07/26/09 11:44:38 PM): no, that is a 'lower' drive.

geo_allino (08/02/09  9:40:23 PM): you wanna know one reason why?
geo_allino (08/02/09  9:40:39 PM): let me tell you this, and teach you a lesson about your civil rights
geo_allino (08/02/09  9:40:50 PM): when you save a chat log you are incriminateing yourself. <span class="code_c">(<i>he means - incriminating HIM</i>)
geo_allino (08/02/09  9:41:04 PM): lets say, in your future, you get used to saving chat logs....
geo_allino (08/02/09  9:41:27 PM): and then you get involved in some issue or crime where you didint even know you were making a mistake.
geo_allino (08/02/09  9:41:37 PM): OR, maybe you are doing something wrong...
geo_allino (08/02/09  9:41:55 PM): NEVER create evidenve againce yourself!!
geo_allino (08/02/09  9:42:09 PM): and the first thing the police cease is YOUR COMPUTER
kelliemariem@ymail.com (08/02/09  9:42:13 PM): wow i didnt think of that
geo_allino (08/02/09  9:42:20 PM): looking for evidence they can use against YOU <span class="code_c">(<i>this is an interesting intimidation tactic - he is trying to make the child think that SHE will get into trouble if she saves their chat logs</i>)
geo_allino (08/02/09  9:42:38 PM): and that is a direct violation of your 5th amendment rights to 'self incrimination
kelliemariem@ymail.com (08/02/09  9:44:27 PM): omg whew

kelliemariem@ymail.com (08/04/09  9:44:15 PM): :( omg
geo_allino (08/04/09  9:44:31 PM): and i would rather die than go to jail with people thinking i was out to hurt you or take advantage of you. <span class="code_c">(<i>more guilt and threats to intimidate the child</i>)
kelliemariem@ymail.com (08/04/09  9:44:37 PM): i dont want u to die
