Folks meet Ryan. Ryan is, at least at the time of this posting, a member of the FDNY. He is attached to an Engine Company in Brooklyn NY.

Before going any further I want to make it perfectly clear that none of us involved with this bust see this as a reflection upon the fine men and women of the FDNY, but rather see it as a reflection upon one person that happens to be a member of the FDNY, and who shouldn't be in a position of such respect and authority.

None of us in the room on Monday the 8th was expecting what transpired when Ryan IM'd me. At several points on Monday night we kept hoping he would disengage and leave me alone, but it was not to be. Ryan admits to driving by the bust house on Wednesday morning, but was scared off because he saw a cop car parked next door and thought it was a setup. He was on his way back to molest me when he got into an accident, and due to time constraints we had to abandon the bust house. Ryan still got his 15 minutes of fame though.

Here is where I normally give special thanks to whoever made the verification call for me, but in this case that isn't nearly enough. While I may be the one that had the chat with Ryan, and therefore am the one posting him, without Harvey at my side giving me input and feedback, making and receiving all the calls to and from Ryan while she was in the guise of 14 year old Ashley, and making sure that I had all the right answers to Ryan's questions, I wouldn't be making this post. I truly admire and respect her for the bravery, tenacity, and professionalism she showed during the entire three days in NY.

This bust truly was a team effort and involved many people that I'm not at liberty to mention at the moment. They all know who they are, and since I'm sure they'll all be reading this, let me extend my heartfelt thanks to each and every one of them for their time, effort, dedication, and camaraderie. It was three days that I'm sure none of us will ever forget.

Any blank lines in the chat log are emoticons that don't show up when a chat is pasted from a Yahoo archive file.

And without further ado I give you Ryan...

ryan4686 (7:55:52 PM): yes

Here Harvey called and chatted with Ryan...

In Harvey's own words she describes the call...

Called him and verified that it was him.  Idle chit-chat took place concerning my mom being out of town and him being a firefighter. One exchange of note did take place:
Me: \"You're so brave to do that.\"
Him: \"Well, it's what I've wanted to do my whole life.\"

Harvey told Ryan that she was getting a call and had to take it.

<span class="code_chat">ryan4686 (8:04:28 PM): is it your mom?
cuteashley4u1990 (8:04:39 PM): yeah. im almost done.
ryan4686 (8:04:42 PM): ok
ryan4686 (8:05:44 PM): actually you're too young, sorry <span class="code_c">(<i>Yes! I wasn't happy with Ryan for the conversation he had with a minor up to this point, but it appeared that he was going to do the right thing. I pushed him a little, but when it appeared that he was really going to leave me alone I stopped talking to him.</i>)
cuteashley4u1990 (8:07:04 PM): y??

ryan4686 (8:09:50 PM): I would
ryan4686 (8:09:51 PM): sorry

I figured that Ryan was sincere and so I decided to stop talking to him and concentrate on other wannabes that were IMing me.

Unfortunately I was wrong about Ryan, and he IMed me again about five minutes later.

<span class="code_chat">ryan4686 (8:14:02 PM): where would we go? <span class="code_c">(<i>Damn! He was free and clear as far as we were concerned, and then he has to send me a message like that.</i>)

cuteashley4u1990 (8:46:45 PM): ok.
Yahoo! Messenger:  ryan4686 has logged out. (3/8/2004 8:48 PM)

A little while later Ryan IMs me again. I figured that he had gotten back from the wake and would want to come over so I ignored him, as the folks that really wanted to be present when he showed up had gone home for the night.

<span class="code_chat">ryan4686 (9:55:21 PM): Still on

Now wouldn't you know it? The whole time we've been at the bust house we haven't seen a single cop, but now a Nassau County Sheriff's patrol car is parked right next door to the bust house. Ryan sees the cop and thinks it's a setup, and calls Harvey and tries to play it off like he has come to his senses.

In Harvey's own words...

He drives by the house and gets spooked.  He calls me while I'm standing outside and hangs up; I call him back. He recants utterly, saying \"This is wrong.  I can't do this. It's immoral and illegal. I had a momentary lapse of judgment and this should never have happened.\"  I ask him why he's doing this to me and what's wrong; he doesn't really answer and says that he has to go.

I wait about an hour and IM him...

<span class="code_chat">cuteashley4u1990 (11:00:00 AM): hey

An hour passes and then I see him come back online...

Here Ryan turned off the camera and logged off. We didn't know what had happened until he got back online and told me about his computer crashing.

Harvey called just before Ryan came back on. In her own words...

I left a message asking him if the car was done and what he was doing.

Harvey had several conversations with Ryan after this. It appears that he got into a car accident, and was delayed longer then we could wait.

Called him at 5:30.  Folks were there fixing his car.

Called him at 5:45.  Folks were still fixing his car.

Called him at 6:00.  He was heading back over and was supposed to call when 
he was on my street.

He called me at 6:15 and hung up; I called him back and he explained that he had gotten into a fender bender and had to wait for the police.

I called him at 6:30 and left a message telling him if he wouldn't be there by 7 to not bother showing up and that we'd reschedule.

I called him at 6:45 and left a message telling him that we would reschedule and not to come.

--

The reason Harvey told him that we needed to reschedule was because we had to vacate the bust house that evening.

Yesterday, March 16th, 2004, Ryan was confronted while leaving the station for FDNY Engine Company 237 in Brooklyn. He admitted to coming over to the bust house on Wednesday morning. He also tried to feed those that confronted him a whole list of lies that they were able to easily refute, due to the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

We know almost everything there is to know about Ryan. Harvey will be starting Ryan's follow up thread and it will contain all the pertinent information.

Ryan knows he is going to be very famous, but he has no idea about PeeJ.
