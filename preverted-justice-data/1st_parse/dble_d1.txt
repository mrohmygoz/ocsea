<i>And of course, he did show up. He parked in front of the house, lifted the hood of his car, and smoked a cigarette. He was a wee bit reluctant to come in. He was taken into custody by the fine officers of Waukesha County and had an impromptu interview with TMJ4's John Mercure, right there by the side of the road. Thanks to both the Waukesha County Sheriff's Department and TMJ4 for the work put into this sting, and special thanks to Van De Camp for the tag-team work on this!</i>
