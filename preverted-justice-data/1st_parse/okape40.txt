okape40 (07/23/09 6:37:41 PM): not if you play games with them geeze...dont get all grown up so much you cant still be silly and fun :)
mistygray013 (07/23/09 6:38:02 PM): like if he wasnt a brat all the time 
mistygray013 (07/23/09 6:39:11 PM): he got kicked out of his daycare
mistygray013 (07/23/09 6:39:19 PM): thats how come i got stuck with him
okape40 (07/23/09 6:39:59 PM): well sure, but the way you beat a breat is by outthinking em
mistygray013 (07/23/09 6:41:00 PM): ok like he was jumpin on the couch
mistygray013 (07/23/09 6:41:14 PM): so what wouuld u do 2 make him stop
okape40 (07/23/09 6:41:55 PM): well what is he insecure about or does he hate
mistygray013 (07/23/09 6:42:22 PM): idk
mistygray013 (07/23/09 6:42:29 PM): he likes 2 bite people
mistygray013 (07/23/09 6:42:36 PM): thats how come he got kicked out
okape40 (07/23/09 6:43:41 PM): lol thats the opposit of what I asked....you have to use information against him...like if you were afraid of what a certain girl would think if you did something I might use her to say what you were doing would make you look bad in front of her or whatever
okape40 (07/23/09 6:43:59 PM): or you just act like what he is doing makes him look like an idiot
okape40 (07/23/09 6:44:03 PM): or whatever
okape40 (07/23/09 6:44:15 PM): bt you have to figure out what his motive is
okape40 (07/23/09 6:44:24 PM): does he want attention? dont give it to him
okape40 (07/23/09 6:44:33 PM): etc etc
mistygray013 (07/23/09 6:45:19 PM): omg then he will like tear up everyting n then i will get in trouble 4 letting him when my uncle gets hom
mistygray013 (07/23/09 6:45:21 PM): home
okape40 (07/23/09 6:46:33 PM): well seems like you should say to the uncle that he doesnt listen, and that threats dont work either, so if uncle comes home and its broken the kid should be punished so he learns there are consequences
mistygray013 (07/23/09 6:47:02 PM): like i cant wait till they get a new day care
okape40 (07/23/09 6:47:30 PM): its simpleo though there have to be things he wants or that motivate him
okape40 (07/23/09 6:47:41 PM): if you use levers you are just doing what parents have done forever
mistygray013 (07/23/09 6:47:53 PM): ok
okape40 (07/23/09 6:49:06 PM): just have to think and figure out what the motivations of his actions are
mistygray013 (07/23/09 6:49:31 PM): i wish we didnt move here
okape40 (07/23/09 6:50:10 PM): well I know you miss your friends, but is it really that bad? At least you have a place to stay and food in your belly - lots of people have it worse these days
mistygray013 (07/23/09 6:50:58 PM): ya i know
mistygray013 (07/23/09 6:51:06 PM): i just really miss my friends

okape40 (07/28/09 9:44:05 PM): well, sex stuff is really fun by yourself if you know how...I masturbate every night...most people do unless they are married or living with someone
mistygray013 (07/28/09 9:44:21 PM): really?
okape40 (07/28/09 9:44:24 PM): yes
okape40 (07/28/09 9:44:26 PM): really
mistygray013 (07/28/09 9:44:28 PM): its diff 4 guys
okape40 (07/28/09 9:44:29 PM): its super secret
okape40 (07/28/09 9:44:34 PM): but everyone does, most girls too
mistygray013 (07/28/09 9:45:12 PM): how come its secret
okape40 (07/28/09 9:45:41 PM): because our society is reallllly wierd about sex, its like church related, everyone does it but everyone feels guilty because its \"sinful\" supposedly
mistygray013 (07/28/09 9:46:07 PM): oh
mistygray013 (07/28/09 9:46:08 PM): k
okape40 (07/28/09 9:46:39 PM): and also because, for instance, guys are such jerks...if you told them they would say bad things about you....but those same guys all want to do it with everyone but its ok for them
okape40 (07/28/09 9:46:42 PM): its silly
mistygray013 (07/28/09 9:46:57 PM): ya
mistygray013 (07/28/09 9:47:03 PM): kinda like my x bf
mistygray013 (07/28/09 9:47:17 PM): he was all nice n then he was a jerk
okape40 (07/28/09 9:47:20 PM): yes, he sounds like he was mean and tried to trick you instead of making you want to be with him etc
mistygray013 (07/28/09 9:47:30 PM): ya
okape40 (07/28/09 9:48:24 PM): boo ex bf
mistygray013 (07/28/09 9:48:33 PM): ya lol!!
okape40 (07/28/09 9:49:17 PM): so anyway, you know how you have two lips down there that kind of form a circle but there is a top area where they kind of join
mistygray013 (07/28/09 9:49:30 PM): ya
okape40 (07/28/09 9:50:03 PM): ok, well right below where they join, if you rub gently you will notice something growing and that it feels good but tickles a little too...thats called your clitoris
mistygray013 (07/28/09 9:50:17 PM): kk
okape40 (07/28/09 9:50:26 PM): many girls are more turned on by clitoral stimulation than pushing in
okape40 (07/28/09 9:50:37 PM): but almost all girls like to rub clitoris while they push in
mistygray013 (07/28/09 9:50:53 PM): ok
mistygray013 (07/28/09 9:57:08 PM): did u leave?
