Ahh, yes.  FOTOPHIX.  I've been waiting anxiously to post this asshat, as have a lot of you site readers, I'm sure.  You may remember him from such Dateline specials as To Catch A Predator:  Fort Myers, Florida.  This is the asshat that made me (and many other people) physically ill.  For you see, apparently \"Jason\" (real name: Clifford) thought it would be a good idea to bring his 5-year-old son with him for a sexual liason with a 14-year-old boy he had just met on the Internet.

So yeah, FOTOPHIX is a special kind of dirtbag.  As you can see, this chat is exceptionally brief.  It would have been longer, but this predator was adament about not typing what his intentions were.  

As you read the chat, you will notice that FOTOPHIX appears to be practiced at carefully wording his statements.  His constant references to \"fun,\" wanting to meet and \"see what happens\" - all implicate that he knew what he was doing, and he knew what he was doing was wrong. 

And now, the chat:

The conversation switches to the phone.  Once on the phone, Clifford was still guarded, but eventually he spilled his true intentions to Del.  The calls were being recorded by the FDLE, so the phone calls, along with the chat above, were enough to charge and convict Wallach.
