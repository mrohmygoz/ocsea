Readers of PeeJ, meet Dallas.  As you can see from the pictures above (and from what you will read in the chatlogs), Dallas is a creepy, creepy man.  The picture on the right is what he sent me; the picture on the left is what showed up.  Dallas IMed me after finding my 14-year-old decoy sittingin the Fort Myers gay.com chatroom.  Consequently, the chat starts on gay.com and migrates over to America Online for the last part of it.  So, without further delay, the chatlogs.....:
