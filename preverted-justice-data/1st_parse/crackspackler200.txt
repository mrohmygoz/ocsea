PHONE VERIFIER NOTES:

On Wednesday, January 4, 2006, a Perverted-Justice.com Contributor, known to me as Oscar Mayer contacted me requesting that I call and verify a phone number given by a bust, known to Oscar Mayer as Chris. Contributor Oscar Mayer gave me the phone number, and I dialed *** at approximately 10:13 pm EST. The call lasted approximately three minutes.

When a (male) answered the phone, I asked for Chris. He said, "Speaking." I introduced myself as Dana. He said I sound cute. Really cute. He asked if I was excited. I said I was. He asked if I was nervous. I said I was a little. He said it's okay. He asked what I was up to. I said nothing. He asked if I've been thinking about him. 
I said I had been. He confirmed that Mom was out drinking on the porch with the neighbors. I asked if he got the money yet and he said he hadn't and that he's sorry. He said, "I suck, I know." Then said I was supposed to laugh. I giggled a little. He said I sound tiny and cute. I said thank you. He said he'd love to be with me. I said I would, too. He 
asked if I thought about him a lot. I said yeah. He asked if I thought about making out. I said a little. He said, "Don't lie, you think about it a lot." I said that I didn't want my calling card minutes to run out, so we'd talk online. We said goodbye.

The bust had no accent or distinct background noise.

I do hereby affirm, under penalty of perjury, the foregoing to be true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Christopher:  Hey sweetie, I was just looking over your page and noticed that you weren't sure of your sexual orientation. Have you ever thought about kissing a girl? If you have thought about it, then that's cool. What's even cooler is if you've actually done it. Hehe...I think it would be cool to watch you kiss another girl and then maybe I could join in and fuck the both of you. 
Anywayz...I signed back in to Yahoo but you weren't on so...Goodnight! 

1/26/06

Christopher: LOL...hey sweetie! I noticed "Steve" on your friends list. He looks like such a loser! Dump him for me, baby! I'm much better looking than him, don't you think? 
Chat with ya on Yahoo tomorrow! 
*kiss*

Marijuana: Hi,
You have been invited by Silver to join Marijuana Myths blog group on Myspace.
Blog group name: Marijuana Myths
Description: Since it's prohibition, back in the 1930's, marijuana has been the whipping boy of right-wingers, biased scientists and scape-goaters. The myths perpetuated by our "illustrious" government are unfounded and some of them are just plain silly. 
The purpose of this blog group is to reveal the lies and dismiss the propaganda as utter nonsense! 
Read on, enlighten yourself and tell someone about how they have been lied to all of these years. And above all else, smoke out a friend today!
Click the pic or name if you'd like to view the profile first, or you can choose to subscribe immediately by clicking the link below:

Marijuana: This is a duplicate email that I just sent to your Yahoo account. In case you check this first. 
Hey Dana! I'm neither mad at you nor am I ignoring you in spite of what you wrote in your Myspace blog. Yeah, I read that... 

Here's what you wrote, remember? 
"someone that i used to think was for real is iggying me now and it hurts, i cant help that im not online all the time but i try and i hope he 4gives me bc i need for him to keep that promise. u know who ur and please talk to me" 

I do forgive you for not being online that often. You mom's giving you alot of shit, huh? Well, I want to come pick you up this week. There's still a couple of things that I have to work out but I'm coming, ok? I'm going to give you a list of stuff to do... 
Pack one bag w/some essential items i.e. 2 or 3 changes of clothes, soap, shampoo, etc., and whatever else you think you might need 
Tell me where you want me to meet you and give me the address...the closest Circle K, perhaps? 
That's actually all I can think of right now, Dana. Hopefully, you read this today. I won't be able to reply to any of your responses until tomorrow. I've been kicked out of where I was living and only have internet access from the library. I'll explain everything to you when I see you, sweetie. Are you excited? I know I am!! 
So do those things for me and I'll email back. I should know more about coming to get you later. I'm thinking around Thursday or Friday. But I'll let you know. 
Until then, sweetie! 
Christopher...A.K.A. "Your new Daddy"


2/23/06

Marijuana: Hey Dana! Since I have not heard from you since my last email, I am forced to wait to come and get you. I can't just come and not know if you are ready. My roommate kicked me out with virtually no warning and am currently living on the streets with almost no money to speak of. But I will find a way to come and get you so we can be together. Trust me, Dana. 
I assume that your Mother has forbidden you access to the computer and that's why you haven't been online in three days. 
I'll be checking for your reply, 
Christopher 

2/23/06
Marijuana: I'm ok in spite of my current living conditions. 
I don't have long on here, about another 15 minutes. The mall sounds good if you can get there. Is it possible to give me an address? 
My cell phone is now inactive so there is no way to contact me except through here. 
Reply back, ok?

im worried about u are u ok?? i was thinkin i would ask my mom to drop me off at the galleria mall this weekend what u think? 

2/23/06
Marijuana: I'll be back online tomorrow to check for your reply. 
Only a few more days baby! 
Thinking of you, 
Christopher 


2/24/06

Marijuana: So on what day will your mom drop you off there? Saturday or Sunday? What city is that mall in? I need more info. I may have a car to drive there but I'm not sure. 
I'm kinda having second thoughts about meeeting you simply because I'm paranoid about this being a set-up. Ever hear of a website called http://www.perverted-justice.com/ go check it out and you'll see why I'm paranoid. Nevertheless, I believe that you are for real. 
The library here is open until 5:00 pm and I believe they shut down the computer room about a half hour before closing so please reply before then, ok? 
Christopher

Marijuana:  That link I sent you is not porn. Perverted Justice is a website that has people posing as underage girls in chatrooms then when the "underage girl" and an older person decide to meet they arrest that person. 
Here's an excerpt from their website. It tells of their goal. 
Our goal is rather simple and specific, actually. A lot of people will say "hey, you guys aren't ending pedophilia." Well no, we don't "end pedophilia as we know it." That's not our goal. The goal of this website and our endeavors is to create a "chilling effect" in regional chat rooms and other easy targets of opportunity online such as social networking websites. Simply stated, we want to poison the well of these rooms and places by covering enough of them that even if you're looking for underage females, an extra bit of paranoia will cross your mind. 
We believe that regional chat rooms and social networking sites are the most ready and easy way for an individual to try to "hook up with" underage females. Many parents don't understand the harms and dangers their child faces by going into those rooms. Basically, you're letting complete strangers into your childs bedroom or frontroom. And since it's "regional," these people don't live that far away. A kid goes into this cesspool, they're basically at the mercy of chance. Our goal is to help reduce that chance by covering these rooms to a point where we have an impact and create an atmosphere where such happenings become rarer and rarer. 
Additionally, we have the goal of turning the website into a conviction machine with as many information first agreements with police as possible. As of this writing, our Information First agreements cover over 2/3rds of the United States. These agreements have been invaluable in our endeavors to toss as many people in jail as possible. 
And this is from their front page...there was a big bust in Riverside!! 
Just because the main page hasn't been updated doesn't mean we're slacking. Laguna Beach police contacted us in January after the Riverside Sting of 51 internet predators over three days became public wanting to do the same thing right next door in Laguna Beach, California. Saturday, February 18th, they set up a place in Laguna and gave us eleven hours to see what we could do... the result? 13 men solicting our profiles for sex. Working the same area that we worked for Riverside... only two weeks after Dateline 3 aired... they're still out there looking for kids. 
This sting saw men from all walks of life arrive to be arrested, from a Starbucks employee all the way up to a lieutenant in the California Highway Patrol. Read the Orange County DA's press release here where more details are given by O.C. DA Tony Rackauckas. 13 men in one night is the fourth time in a little over a month where we have set a new national standard for the amount of predators arrested in one night in one county. Before Riverside, the record was five... a record we have more than doubled each night in the four nights we have worked large-scale stings with law enforcement in California. 
If you are a law enforcement professional and would like to know more about our operation, please read this link. A very special and public thanks to both the Orange County DA and the Laguna Beach police we worked with to make this happen, they were one of the first departments to contact us in the wake of Riverside and were a pleasure to work with. 
See why I'm paranoid!!??

Marijuana: I'm not coming. I'm sorry but I'm just too paranoid about going to jail for this that it's really got me freaked out. If you get a chance when you get home go to that website and read why I'm so freaked. 
I'll be thinking of you. 

2/27/06

Marijuana: I don't know, Dana. I'm just hella confused right now. I'll be online later on today so we can message each other about this, ok? I'm not sure if the library's computers will allow me to have Yahoo IM installed on it but I'll try. If not, then we'll have to message each other through here. 
Chat with ya later,

Marijuana: I actually only correspond with one other girl on my list but not even lately. I've been very low-profile as of late. 
I haven't forgotten about you, it's just that I'm unsure of risking anything with you. Even if you weren't posing as a young girl trying to set me up, then there's still the risk of me getting caught for kidnapping you of some crazy shit like that. 
I know what you're saying..."But you wouldn't be kidnapping me, I'd be going with you on my own free will." Yeah, try telling that to the police. But I'll keep in touch. Take care, Dana.

Christopher: Are you ignoring me now? 
I sent you a message a few days ago from my "Marihuana" profile asking about the new pic you have up and you haven't replied but I know you seen it because you just logged in today. 

What's up, Dana? 


3/16/06

Marijuana: LOL...Damn! I just sent a message from my other profile asking why you hadn't replied yet. Guess I should've checked this one first. I'm a dumbass! LMAO!

Marijuana: I am not hooking up with anyone right now and I apologize for "bailing" on you but you have see this from my perspective! I'm paranoid about being set up and going to jail for trying to seduce a 13 yr old girl on the internet. Damn! 
As for my situation right now, I'm still living on the street! Just hang in there and keep checking your messages on here. I'll try to make this happen for us. Ok? If your Mom's ready to kick you out then why don't you just jump on a bus and come see me? If you want to be with a 37 yr old man then you have to grow up a bit, be a big girl and not be scared about riding a bus for about 10 hours. It's really not that long of a trip.

Nah, I'm not back with her nor will I be. However, I am over at her apartment right now using her computer. We're still friends....so that's cool...I guess. 
I'm still living outside trying to decide on what to do with my life because it's come to a "crossroads" in my life right now. 
Damn, Dana...now that I've seen your new pic, I reaaallly want to see you. Do you still want to get together? I really don't mean to lead you on or anything or tease you. If we could just close the distance between us, baby...

Christopher: Religion camp?! Ugh! Sux to be young and at the mercy of your parents, huh? Should that happen, my advice to you is to wear a large pentacle around your neck while you're there. They'll like that! Hehehe... 
Right now I'm crashing on various friends' couches. Just hanging out. It's actually very liberating not having to worry about getting a job and paying bills but I know that I must do so soon. *sigh* Sux to be an adult too! 
Chat with ya later! 
Oh yeah, I really miss chatting with you too.

Christopher: Let's stick with Saturday at the Norco library. 
No, I didn't get a car. I've been trying to sell my bicycle to get some money for a bus ticket ($64.50). The dude that was suppossed to buy it yesterday backed out on me. That's why I said that I could be leaving as early as today. Oh well. There is another guy interested though. I'm still waiting to hear back from him. Hopefully he will buy it today or tomorrow. 
In the meantime, wait to hear from me. I'll let you know something in the next few days. So keep check on your Myspace messages!! 

Love, Daddy

Christopher: Yes, bring your money, whatever you can carry and I'd prefer to get away as soon as possible. We could probably get a hotel room for the night and leave the next day. To where? Well, we'll think of something. 
Oh! And yes...We're going to get your nose pierced too!! 
How does that sound?

Christopher: A question 
I'm just curious, but why are you so willing to leave with me after I have gotten your hopes up twice before and not come through? Not that I'm complaining.... 


7/27/06

Christopher: I'm really trying, sweetie. I'm also hoping to sell this IPod I have and a cell phone which I no longer has service. So hopefully between the above 2 items and my bike, I'll pull together some scratch so we can be together. 
P.S. *crossing my fingers* 
Love, Christopher a.k.a. Daddy

Marijuana: Yeah, I'm here for a few more minutes. The daily time limit on internet use is 2 hours so I have to hit and run all day. I've already been on for a half an hour so I need to log off soon and come back in about an hour. 
I still haven't sold anything. This chick yesterday hella-wanted to buy my bike but it was too big for her. Oh well. 
Tomorrow may not happen. How does going to the library on Sunday work for you? I'll keep pushing it back one day until I get this stuff sold and buy my bus ticket. 
I'm serious this time, Dana!

:( its not open sun but it is mon i can ask to get dropped off


7/28/06  

Christopher: A new better idea 
Hey! I just remembered. 
Well, hold on...let me give you the good news first! I sold the IPod today for a cool $100 so that gives me ample money to buy my bus ticket, which I will do tomorrow. Unfortunately, I have to go all the way to San Jose...about 30 miles from where I am (Foster City). 
I still have yet to sell my bike though and I can't just leave it behind or bring it with either. I want to sell it. So what I was thinking is this...if I bought a bus ticket tomorrow for a week in advance, leaving next Sunday, it would save me $20. The tickets are cheaper when purchased a week in advance. 
I have a question for you. Do you think the mall is closer to the Greyhound station or is the Norco Library? I've already checked and the library is about 17 miles from the Greyhound. Could you give me an address for the nearest mall? Could you get your mom to drop you off there the following Monday? It would actually be better because there are more people which means less chance of anyone seeing us leaving together. 
Soooo....I got some cash so I'll go buy a phone card and call you sometime tomorrow. Does that sound cool? Try to get the phone from your Mom tomorrow. 

OK, sweetie....*BIG HUG and a kiss from Daddy* 


7/29/06

Christopher: Good! You got this message! I didn't know if you did or not because Myspace was acting cracked yesterday afternoon. I sent the same message to your Yahoo email, just in case. How often do you check that anywayz? 
So what's the address of the mall? I need to know. If it's closer from the Greyhound station, we can meet there. Or just give me the name of the mall. I can look it up online. 
Sorry about selling the IPod. Didn't know you wanted one. I'll give you a big hug, kiss and a squeeze to make up for it when I see you!! 
I have a potential buyer for my inoperative cellphone today. That should bring me another $95. Goddamn it! Noone wants my bike!! I can't just leave her behind. If I sell the phone, I may just give my bike to someone, provided that I deem them worthy of taking care of her. 
I'll give you a call today. Not sure what time. Just be ready. 

Love, Daddy...

Christopher: Good work, baby!! I bought my ticket today! I don't depart until 10pm 
tonite &amp; arrivingn Riverside at around 9:00 tomorrow morning. So if you can get your mom to drop you at the Riverside City Library tomorrow morning, that would be cool. In fact, that would be AWESOME!!! 
This is for real, sweetie!!! I'm on my way!!!!! Oh...I forgot to tell ya...I cut my hair hella-short!!! It's buzzed. 
Anywayzz....I'll most likely meet you out front of the library. I'm sure you'll recognize me. I'll be wearing khaki pants with a green long sleeve button down shirt and carrying a green messenger bag. 
See you tomorrow morning!!!! 
Big Hug!!!!

Christopher: Just to confirm...Let's meet at the Riverside City Library. The one that you Mapquested here. That's most likely the closest. Again...good work! I' m not sure what time it opens but i'm assuming around 10:00 am so I'll be there when your Mom drops you. If I don't see you by 12:00, I'm gonna freak!!! LOL....I'll call the number you gave me. 

Check this....sometime today....delete all of my messages and delete me as a friend. Write down any necessary info on paper and delete whatever is online. You know the deal. Myspace has been in the hot seat lately with child-abduction cases. Understand? I don't want any online links between me and you. 
WOW!!! Tomorrow, baby! I'm gonna scoop you up and kiss you!! Ya wanna have sex in the library bathroom? 
Hehehehehe.....I can't wait! 
Love from Daddy!
