<span class="code_chat"><span class="code_c">(<i>1/20/05 UPDATE - On January 19, 2005 Ronald Vernon McCullough pled guilty, in a Humboldt County Court room to one count 288.2(a),  he's been tenatively set for sentencing on 2/16/05.  Stay tuned.</i>)

The log you are about to read has already resulted in the arrest and indictment of RonMcCullough. We worked with police before posting publicly to ensure that this teacher of 36 years would teach no more and face the charges he so rightfully deserves.  More information on the forums. 

I was not in a chat room when Ron initiated this chat.  In fact, the profile was less than a week old.  Ron had to have been out trolling profiles, looking for a local child to hit up.

\"I called Ron AKA icepirate53 at edit at approximately 9:50 PM. He answered and confirmed that he was Ron. 

He said it was nice to hear my voice, and asked me to tell him more about myself. I said I didn't know what he wanted to know. He asked what I looked like, and I said I was 5 feet tall, blond hair, brown eyes. He asked what size \"boobs\" I had, I giggled and said \"none really, well kinda\". He commented that they are still growing.

He asked what school I went to, and I replied I went to Winship Middle School. I asked his age several times, and he would not give me an answer. I asked if he had kids, he replied that they did, that the kids were older and no longer in high school. 

He asked if I was a virgin, I replied that I was. He kept asking what I'd like to do. I said I'd like to see a movie and go shopping. He said he had something sexual in mind and asked if I was interested in sex. I replied that I was kind of curious. He asked if I was \"sexually active at all\". I replied that I had \"made out\". He kept asking what exactly I had done sexually, and I kept replying \"nothing really\". Finally I told him I didnt know what he wanted me to say, andI was embarassed to talk about it. He said he wanted to meet and was open to doing whatever I wanted. I told him I was sleepy, and would rather meet Saturday. He asked if my mom worked all night all the time. I said she does usually. He suggested meeting tomorrow, Wednesday night. I asked if he would come to my house or meet me somewhere. He said he would meet me. I suggested Sacred Heart Church, and he knew where that was. He asked when mom would go to work, and I said around 8pm. We ended the call at approximately 10 PM with the understanding that I would call him back at 7pm on Wednesday.\"
