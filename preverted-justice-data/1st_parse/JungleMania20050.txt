Verification call was made.  Talked in a sexual nature about what he wanted to do when he got there.  Was still extremely nervous about getting caught.

Ken did make his date with Rockie, as everyone who watched Dateline:  To Catch A Predator - Darke County saw.  For all of his paranoia, he couldn't resist the thought of having sex with a young kid.  Thankfully there wasn't really a 14-year-old there home alone.  Ken ended up meeting PeeJ, Chris Hansen, and the Darke County Sheriff's Office instead.
