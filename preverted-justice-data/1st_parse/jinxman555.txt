clayla13 (04/19/15 12:08:38 AM): that would b hard to b with someone that doesnt like to touch.
jinxman555 (04/19/15 12:09:45 AM): It is

jinxman555 (04/22/15 11:18:53 PM): Yeah...it was pretty minor, but I was classified as epileptic and took medication for about 5 years
clayla13 (04/22/15 11:19:22 PM): I'm sorry that must have been scary

clayla13 (04/22/15 11:27:02 PM): I think in everything but with music and creating art there is a feeling of peace and happiness. 
clayla13 (04/22/15 11:27:19 PM): and in nature of course

jinxman555 (04/22/15 11:47:10 PM): It's a little bit futuristic and about a guy who falls in love with his computer operating system.
jinxman555 (04/22/15 11:47:17 PM): Yes, you read that right haha
clayla13 (04/22/15 11:48:10 PM): Is it where he spills something on the computer
jinxman555 (04/22/15 11:48:18 PM): But it challenges the notions of what love is. It was fascinating
clayla13 (04/22/15 11:49:36 PM): Idk what it was called but I saw a movie like that where the computer came to life kinda
jinxman555 (04/22/15 11:49:41 PM): http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/

clayla13 (04/22/15 11:55:25 PM): It was good but I was getting irritated with it
jinxman555 (04/22/15 11:56:01 PM): what irritated you?
clayla13 (04/22/15 11:56:30 PM): they go somewhere and know that time will pass faster but don't think about the fact that by the time the set things up there the Earth won't have anyone left
jinxman555 (04/22/15 11:57:10 PM): exactly! Yes for all their brilliance they weren't very smart
