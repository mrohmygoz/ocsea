Ronnelle was special.  He was from Indiana, and didn't seem to have a problem driving to Ohio to have sex with a child he believed to be 13 years of age.  He seemed to have no problem at all, since this chatlog took, from time of first contact to the time he left the house, two hours and five minutes.  He also seemed to think that he was entrapped, which I find rather amusing since this is not the only child profile from Ohio he was speaking with and planned to have sex with at the time he arrived at our house in Greenville to be interviewed by Chris Hansen and arrested by the Darke County Sheriffs.  Without further adieu, I offer you a rather unremarkable and not very graphic log, but the final case in 18 arrests of Dateline: Greenville, OH.
