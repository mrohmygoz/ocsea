breeisme93 (05/16/08 10:50:24 PM): Wow, I am so jealous.
chaznd74 (05/16/08 10:50:27 PM): her and her husband bought a brand new pop up
chaznd74 (05/16/08 10:50:57 PM): she told my mom they wont use it alot, and we could borrow it anytime they are not using it
breeisme93 (05/16/08 10:51:16 PM): That is really neat for you.
chaznd74 (05/16/08 10:51:23 PM): yes it is
chaznd74 (05/16/08 10:52:02 PM): now I just need to find a gf to bring camping with us
breeisme93 (05/16/08 10:52:14 PM): well she will be lucky for sure.
chaznd74 (05/16/08 10:52:46 PM): yes but it seems not many women I meet want to be that lucky gal <span class="code_c">(<i>Because you are an idiot and lots of women don't like dating men that want to have sex with kids.</i>)
breeisme93 (05/16/08 10:52:58 PM): that sucks
chaznd74 (05/16/08 10:53:32 PM): yes it does
breeisme93 (05/16/08 10:54:17 PM): Its hard sometimes, thats for sure.
chaznd74 (05/16/08 10:54:49 PM): they all seem to have bfs or are realy big, cant have kids anymore, I am too old for them or something
breeisme93 (05/16/08 10:55:29 PM): what do you mean really big? and how come they cant have kids?
chaznd74 (05/16/08 10:56:21 PM): I mean women that are very over weight, and they have already had all the kids they want to have and have had thier tubes tied
chaznd74 (05/16/08 10:57:34 PM): I am of average size
breeisme93 (05/16/08 10:57:53 PM): i think none of that should matter if people really care about eachother.
chaznd74 (05/16/08 10:57:55 PM): 5' 8" and 165-170 lbs
chaznd74 (05/16/08 10:58:18 PM): there has to be some physical attraction there at first
breeisme93 (05/16/08 10:58:24 PM): so what if someone is fat or too skinny. or kids or not. Or age, none of that should matter if you really care.
chaznd74 (05/16/08 10:58:28 PM): and I still would like to have more kids <span class="code_c">(<i>So you can meet their friends probably. </i>)
breeisme93 (05/16/08 10:58:48 PM): yeah, I want kids. i can see that being important.
breeisme93 (05/16/08 10:59:02 PM): But the other stuff, no, not really.
chaznd74 (05/16/08 10:59:25 PM): but your right I have met some women who I did not care about thier size
chaznd74 (05/16/08 10:59:41 PM): a few not many
chaznd74 (05/16/08 10:59:51 PM): and they already were seeing someone else
breeisme93 (05/16/08 11:00:18 PM): I would rather be with a guy that isnt the cutest, but cares about me, than one who is cute and treats me like crap.
chaznd74 (05/16/08 11:00:29 PM): true
chaznd74 (05/16/08 11:01:06 PM): and as far as age goes, I dont care about age, its just a number, but not many young women feel that way <span class="code_c">(<i>Smooth move there Sparky.</i>)
chaznd74 (05/16/08 11:01:31 PM): I am a nice guy as you have probobly figured out by now <span class="code_c">(<i>You are an egotistical, selfish jerk. </i>)
chaznd74 (05/16/08 11:01:53 PM): but they dont seem to want to give me a chance once they find out how old I am
breeisme93 (05/16/08 11:02:00 PM): I think you are very nice

chaznd1974 (06/03/08  8:20:05 PM): during the Korean war, it was not unheard of for chinese soldiers to be picking 30 carbine bullets out of their winter parkas
chaznd1974 (06/03/08  8:20:21 PM): the round did not have enough power to penetrate the parka
breeisme93 (06/03/08  8:20:40 PM): oh wow

chaznd1974 (06/03/08  8:22:05 PM): but with body armor becoming more prevalent in todays militaries, the 30 carbine had to be phased out
breeisme93 (06/03/08  8:22:19 PM): oh

chaznd1974 (06/12/08  8:58:27 PM): standing next to one of the other coaches
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  8:58:52 PM): when they said my name, the other coach said,"oh god,not another one."

chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:07:06 PM): thats good
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:07:33 PM): Yeah
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:08:34 PM): Child's name removed by La Victoria and I could look for a hunting pouch for my dad on sat, as a fathers day gift
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:08:49 PM): I got the idea last winter
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:08:57 PM): to look for one for him
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:09:01 PM): what it that?
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:09:06 PM): I have one and I love it
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:09:46 PM): its a bag that attaches to my leg and waist, that I carry some of my extra gear in
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:10:40 PM): I put my deer tag in it, my field saw, latex gloves, first aid stuff, and wet wipes
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:11:11 PM): I can carry extra shells in it too
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:11:36 PM): do you use all your guns at the same time?
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:11:46 PM): no
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:12:12 PM): just carry the rest of the box in my pouch
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:12:22 PM): how many guns do you have total?
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:12:35 PM): me I own 3
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:12:55 PM): We don't have any.
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:13:21 PM): I have the 2 I told you about and I inherited my grandfathers 22 rifle
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:13:37 PM): Oh, wow.
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:13:55 PM): yeah, it is also very old
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:14:06 PM): but incredibly acurate
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:14:21 PM): you aren't gonna bring any with you when you come are you?
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:14:25 PM): I can remember shooting gophers with it
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:14:27 PM): no
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:14:37 PM): no reason too
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:14:39 PM): I don't like them.
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:15:23 PM): thats ok
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:15:38 PM): I never really been near one lol.
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:15:59 PM): from what you have told me about your family I am not surprised
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:16:23 PM): my family is into hunting though
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:16:31 PM): so I have guns
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:16:32 PM): Yeah.
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:17:00 PM): I still want to get a couple of newer guns
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:17:12 PM): a new shotgun and deer rifle
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:17:34 PM): because the ones i use are so old and should be put away just on display
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:17:42 PM): yeah
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:18:01 PM): I wouldnt mind getting a pistol or 2 also
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:18:12 PM): but they are not a big deal
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:18:37 PM): I had a 45 long colt revolver at one point
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:19:16 PM): I want to try harvesting a deer with a pistol someday
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:20:08 PM): I have been bow hunting a couple of times when I should have had a pistol
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:20:17 PM): because the deer was too close
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:20:52 PM): couldnt even bring the bow up, the deer was walking past me at less than an arms length
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:21:47 PM): so what would have happened?
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:22:28 PM): if I had had a pistol I could have just shot from the hip and gotten it, no real need to aim when its that close
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:22:49 PM): but with my bow there was no way I could have drawn it back
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:23:08 PM): would have had better luck trying to stab it with my knife
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:24:47 PM): but it was a doe, and she had a fawn with her, she bolted as soon as she got right next to me
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:24:54 PM): she smelled me
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:25:20 PM): the faun is the baby right?
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:25:21 PM): and they ran past me and then stopped about 40 yards out
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:25:26 PM): yup
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:25:42 PM): its spots were gone at that time of the year
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:26:20 PM): why do they go away?
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:26:58 PM): early in the year the fawns have spots to help with camoflage
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:27:15 PM): the adults have bright yellow or reddish coats
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:27:21 PM): so they stand out more
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:28:14 PM): if a preditor approaches the doe tries to get it to follow her, she can easily loose it once she has led it far enough away from the fawn
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:28:31 PM): thats why the does have bright coats
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:28:44 PM): wow I didn't knowthat
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:28:53 PM): later in the year the coats turn dull brown almost grey
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:29:04 PM): so both can hide better
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:29:10 PM): wow
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:29:58 PM): animals are my thing
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:30:27 PM): Thats neat to know.
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:30:31 PM): yup
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:31:09 PM): its difficult to actully see fawn early in the year
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:31:23 PM): they stay hidden mostly
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:31:56 PM): I would have to spend an entire day out in the woods to hope to see some
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:32:06 PM): and hardly move the entire time
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:32:26 PM): wow
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:32:42 PM): although Child's name removed by La Victoria and I were lucky in wisconsin last summer
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:33:07 PM): we were walking down to the lake early in the day, and we spoted a doe and fawn
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:33:09 PM): there are lots there.
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:33:23 PM): when we lived there deer would just walk up the road.
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:33:45 PM): we have them in fargo too
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:34:23 PM): Fargo actually opened up part of the city for a speacial bow season
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:34:37 PM): to reduce the number of deer in the city
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:34:38 PM): eww, Chaz, thats still sad.
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:35:32 PM): some people were complaining about it when it was first proposed, but archers are very good at making a clean kill
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:35:44 PM): so the animal does not suffer
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:36:44 PM): So, it doesn't hurt?
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:37:11 PM): it would still hurt them for a little while, but they die in under a minute
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:37:26 PM): bet that minute sucks.
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:38:05 PM): they have enough adrenaline going through them I doubt they know they were hit
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:38:37 PM): ok
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:39:55 PM): can you tell yet why I am the person my nieces and nephew and my daughter turn to about questions regarding wildlife
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:40:35 PM): Yeah, thats why I am asking too. If I ever have to do a report on that stuff for science, I'm calling you.
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:41:01 PM): it just comes naturally to me
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:41:17 PM): cool
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:41:53 PM): yup, and I love it too
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:42:05 PM): its just incredibly interesting to me

chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:43:18 PM): yeah, I am
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:43:56 PM): I think I might bring the Yahtzee game camping

chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:44:29 PM): if you want to
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:44:45 PM): Only if we aren't gonna fish.

chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:46:59 PM): you roll dice to go around the board
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:47:19 PM): if you land on a green set of tracks you get a question
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:47:32 PM): if you answer the question right you roll again
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:47:51 PM): white tracks and its the end of your turn

chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:48:40 PM): first one back to camp wins
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:49:12 PM): there is a short cut but you have to have gotten a compass quetion and answered it right to use it
breeisme93 (06/12/08  9:49:35 PM): I think it will be easier for me to get it if I see it.
chaznd1974 (06/12/08  9:49:44 PM): probobly

chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:23:42 PM): which is better
chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:24:06 PM): he says crotch rockets are better because they are faster
chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:24:31 PM): I say cruisers are better because they are more comfortable
breeisme93 (06/18/08  9:24:43 PM): what kind do you have?
chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:24:47 PM): and I still say crotch rockets are gay
chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:24:53 PM): I have a cruiser
breeisme93 (06/18/08  9:24:59 PM): cool
breeisme93 (06/18/08  9:25:03 PM): I still want a ride one day.
chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:25:19 PM): you'll get one

chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:26:14 PM): he is right about crotch rockets being faster
chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:26:34 PM): but he admits I am right about cruisers being more comfortable
breeisme93 (06/18/08  9:26:46 PM): you should make one that does both.
chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:27:14 PM): I have joked around and told him I am going to convert his crotch rocket into a cuiser
chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:27:19 PM): cruiser
breeisme93 (06/18/08  9:27:36 PM): ha haha you are smart enough to do it too
chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:28:09 PM): put some longer handle bars on it, rake it out a little, move the shift lever forward
breeisme93 (06/18/08  9:28:32 PM): whats rake it out mean?
chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:29:08 PM): it means to move the front wheel forward
breeisme93 (06/18/08  9:29:34 PM): oh
chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:29:34 PM): on crotch rockets its pretty much right below the handle bars
chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:29:58 PM): on cruisers its forward of them and the shocks angle back and up
breeisme93 (06/18/08  9:30:22 PM): lol, i dont know anything about it 
chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:30:51 PM): it has to do with phisics which you will learn in a couple of years

breeisme93 (06/18/08  9:31:17 PM): im gonna bug you for help with it okay
chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:31:23 PM): ok
chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:32:21 PM): basicaly with the wheel tighter to the body of the bike, the center of gravity when turning is in a better position
chaznd1974 (06/18/08  9:33:30 PM): thats why crotch rockets are designed more for racing
breeisme93 (06/18/08  9:33:46 PM): oh okay

I want to thank LE in Dickinson, North Dakota for all of their help and patience. Deputy Todd Ehresmen was wonderful to work with.  I used Elocin as my verifier. She was new but fantastic. She was great to work with, and very professional so a big thank you to her. I'd like to mention Content Creators here for a minute.  In this chat, he said a few times he studied my myspace. He read blogs, he looked at pictures.  This couldn't be done without all the wonderful volunteers in CC. Thank you for all of your hard work.
