Will was long term with contact lasting over two months.  Several times he expressed a desire to travel 5 hours to deflower little \"Violet\".   He was offered to LE who were unable to take him. Lucky break.  

Will sent \"Violet\" a graphic picture of the wee willy which I have included for your viewing displeasure.

He mentions his children many times during the chat.  They were at times on his cam while he was chatting me up. 

Join us in the Follow up Forum for more information on Will.  His luck has just run out.
