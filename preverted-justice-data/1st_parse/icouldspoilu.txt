Dale Kaup initiated the first message to me that stated \"hey you are really cute\" on exactly 03:19:11 PM PST and the duration of the conversation lasted until 07:32:19 PM PST on September 4, 2004.  There was a cease of conversation between the times of 04:26:03 PM PST until 06:24:20 PM PST whereI was absent from the computer.  The location of the minor who I posed as was Lincoln, Nebraska.  From the initiating message and there on as you will be able to see he turned the tone of the conversation to sexually explicit verbage very quickly, 49 seconds from inception of the conversation to sexual innuendo to be exact.  

Dale was very careful to tell me to delete my chat archives, and also eventually created a new profile that stated he was an underaged teen as to not arise suspicion from my ever-so-absent mother, and non-existant father.  He asked me to babysit for him when his children weren't even there, as again not to arise suspicion, and sleep in his bed where he'd perform sex acts on me.  The chat you see here is, needless to say, chilling.  Now, Dale is the one being chilled.
