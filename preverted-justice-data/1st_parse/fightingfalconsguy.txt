Wondering about that weird middle part?  Here's what happened . . . I got hit up by him under another screenname.  He was testing me to find out if I was for real.  While theoretically, I should have failed horribly, given that I set up a second date for about thirty minutes later . . . I managed to convince him that I was for real and just didn't want to be alone on my birthday.  Here's the second chat.
