jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  5:55:58 PM): what u gotta do is convince Karrie it would be a cowardly thing to die when her mom needs her the most 
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  5:56:33 PM): it's like walking by and doing nothing when u see someone bleeding in the street u wouldn't just walk by without calling for help would u?
samicelery (09/12/11  5:57:26 PM): the thing is karrie didnt say anything like this about dying. It is me thinking about it bcuz that's what i use to think
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  5:57:43 PM): well ur probably right
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  5:57:47 PM): let me guess
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  5:57:49 PM): her dad died?
samicelery (09/12/11  5:57:56 PM): he did
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  5:58:01 PM): thought so

jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  5:58:59 PM): ok babe listen very very carefully alright?
samicelery (09/12/11  5:59:10 PM): ok i will
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  5:59:53 PM): Ok u ogotta convince Karrie that her mother has lost wayyyyyyyyyyy too much already without her adding to that loss by her running out on her don't say dying 
samicelery (09/12/11  6:00:16 PM): ok
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:00:21 PM): u can do that
samicelery (09/12/11  6:00:51 PM): im kinda scared to do it
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:00:58 PM): why?
samicelery (09/12/11  6:01:20 PM): bcuz i dont want her to think im being bossy or something
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:01:35 PM): babe what if she does something to herself 
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:01:42 PM): you'd feel more than scared wouldn't u
samicelery (09/12/11  6:02:51 PM): i think i should stop thinking something bad might happen
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:03:03 PM): good idea
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:03:06 PM): I got an idea
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:03:11 PM): u gotta do it though
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:03:25 PM): up to now u have communicated by email right?
samicelery (09/12/11  6:03:37 PM): and facebook
samicelery (09/12/11  6:03:58 PM): and we want to chat too
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:04:19 PM): ok how do u think ur mom would feel if u called her 
samicelery (09/12/11  6:04:31 PM): i dont know
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:04:39 PM): u can explain
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:04:49 PM): and i could be a matter of life and death
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:05:15 PM): u won't know til u ask and try honey
samicelery (09/12/11  6:05:21 PM): ok
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:05:32 PM): u think she'd respond to ur voice?
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:05:35 PM): Karrie
samicelery (09/12/11  6:07:02 PM): i dont know. i keep thinking it's me that is thinking bad but that karrie isnt thinking the same as me. so i dont want to say anything.
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:07:29 PM): that's why a chat on the phone would help both of you
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:07:43 PM): sometimes a friendly voice is better than something on a keyboard
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:07:46 PM): don't u think?
samicelery (09/12/11  6:07:57 PM): i guess
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:08:21 PM): sweetie
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:08:27 PM): Karrie is family
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:08:53 PM): if you've been through the same experiences with others u have a bond
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:09:13 PM): it's not blood bond but sometimes u don't have to have a blood bond to be family
samicelery (09/12/11  6:09:25 PM): that makes sense
jeff_fisher94 (09/12/11  6:09:33 PM): so Karrie is family
samicelery (09/12/11  6:09:45 PM): ok
