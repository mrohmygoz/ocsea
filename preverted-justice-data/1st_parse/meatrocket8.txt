Ol' meatrocket8 aka Jay Reffner was an odd bloke. First, he hits up my colleague Lady Baltimore who does a textbook chat. Right down the middle, great chat which I will include in this posting. However, Reffner is again, an odd guy. He doesn't go for the girl who is actually interested in him...no, instead he hits up my decoy profile who mocks him, insults him and shows absolutely no interest.

And my profile was the one he ended up meeting Chris Hansen over. Strange world sometimes when you deal with internet predators. 

First chat follows, he had this with Lady Baltimore on March 25th...

So you know, textbook chat. However, he gets weird with her. While chatting with her, he runs into me. I insult him for literally nine minutes straight because I know he's already talked to Lady Baltimore's decoy profile. However, as you'll see, he was more interested in the insulting disinterested girl rather than the laid back interested girl. 

Yes, a strange man indeed. 

Chat he had with my profile between his chat with LB

Yeah, and he showed up. I know, I was just as amazed. I figure he'd no-show for sure after that chat, but the guy was smitten. The most disturbing thing is that I wasn't doing much other than mocking him and talking about random bollocks. Just goes to show you why we play every type of kid and not just one type, predators do make choices regarding the kinds of kids they want to target. 

I seemed unapproachable and very NON-law enforcement with my chat. After all, in a predators mind, what sort of law enforcement would mock them and tell them to basically fuck off? None would, but a PeeJ Contributor will. This chat is a great example fo the variety of kids we play and why we get the results we do.
