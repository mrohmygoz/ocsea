Today I offer, for your perusal and disgust, the chatlogs from Kevin.  

Kevin holds the place of singularly most disgusting, lengthy, and terrifying chat I've ever had as a contributor with Perverted Justice.  Kevin is, without a doubt, a child predator.  This is evident immediately, and I do mean within the first twenty lines of chatting.  Kevin was resourceless as far as leaving his area went, and thus was even more dangerous because he was desperate.  He did everything he could to have contact with children.  Kevin Westerbeck was dangerous and determined.  Kevin McCausland is dangerous, determined, disgusting and desperate.  

In this log, you see many many moods of a child.  Seventh graders are moody little kiddos.  Sometimes they are in a good mood, sometimes a bad one.  It all depends on the minute and which hormone happens to be coursing through their bodies at the time.  Inthis log, I like to think I portrayed as real a child as possible over the four months of chatting.  

Following the logs that eventually led to his conviction for a Criminal Attempt of Child Rape in the Second Degree you will find the logs from Almond Joy, another contributor for the website who talked to McCausland earlier in 2006.  She was unsuccessful at getting him arrested because the state laws in Washington did not provide for felony charging for solicitation of a minor.  It was a misdeameanour to solicit a child in WA until September of 2006, when new legislation took effect making ita Class C felony to solicit a minor using any electronic means.  They also changed the registration statutes and made solicitation, a gross misdemeanour unless committed by electronic means (which makes it a felony), a registrable offense.

This ends my horrid collection of interchanges and chat with Kevin McCausland.  He was arrested on March 27, as I was flying to testify in a trial in Ohio.  I have never, ever, in my entire career as a contributor, been so horrified by a chat and physically affected by chatting with him to the point of exhaustion and nausea. 

Here are Almond Joy's chats, illustrating the importance of strong state law and how determined this predator was.
