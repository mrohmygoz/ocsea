Hahhaa.  Well I saw on Tuesday night you were online at like 4 in the

Anyway.  Instead of being in a bad mood, I've gone to eat.  And then 
I'll be around the house, but obviously not by the computer.  So call me, 
text me, or whatever.  And I'll come back to the computer if you want 
to talk on there.

Printo316 [9:52 PM]:  If I leave Sunday, it'll be Sunday night.  The 
only other option is if I leave Monday morning, but I would have to leave 
early Monday morning, like around 7:00am, which means I would have to 
wake up around 6:00am to shower and stuff.

Alvin N Hobbes91 [9:54 PM]:  what? 
Printo316 [9:54 PM]:  Well, a couple of them actually.
Printo316 [9:54 PM]:  Sex at night time.  And first thing in the 
morning when we wake up would be hot.
Printo316 [9:54 PM]:  But...
Alvin N Hobbes91 [9:55 PM]:  wow 
Printo316 [9:55 PM]:  I've always wanted to fall asleep at night, and 
wake up in the middle of the night, like really late to someone jacking 
me off, or just playing with me.
Alvin N Hobbes91 [9:55 PM]:  k 
Printo316 [9:55 PM]:  You ever done that?
Alvin N Hobbes91 [9:55 PM]:  no but it sounds cool 
Printo316 [9:57 PM]:  Yeah.  But I bet once you fall asleep at night, 
you wouldn't wake up til morning.
Alvin N Hobbes91 [9:57 PM]:  u sure? :D 
Printo316 [9:59 PM]:  No.  But usually people don't wake up in the 
middle of the night.
Printo316 [9:59 PM]:  And you can't set an alarm, cause that would wake 
me up too.  :)
Alvin N Hobbes91 [9:59 PM]:  with uy there i bet i do a lot :)

Hah.  Well I'm not sure if we're going mini golfing anymore, but if we 
do, I'll be sure to grab you a pink ball!
I hope you're good at directions because I won't have access to a 
computer when you call tonight, so sadly I won't be able to mapquest 
anything. ;(
Anyway, I'll talk to you a little later on.  :)
