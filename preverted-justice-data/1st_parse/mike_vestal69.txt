Mike Vestal hit me up during the Petaluma, California sting operation. The above is his ever-so-friendly mugshot. His shirt says \"Be the one.\" Unfortunately for Vestal, he was just one of seven for me that sting.

Vestal veered from paranoia to sex talk to paranoia and back again a few dozen times. He also was very afraid of his wife. We ended up texting right up until the point that he was arrested.
