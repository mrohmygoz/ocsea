notjustanotherncguy (12/27/06  2:56:00 PM): good question, a lot of it depends on the way they seem to feel about me too, if i'm attracted to them physically, they have a good personality and then if they really seem to like me back a lot and we flirt a good bit, then I find myself really liking them a lot by then usually
jensbirdss (12/27/06  2:56:30 PM): u like me?
notjustanotherncguy (12/27/06  2:57:09 PM): i do, i can't say how much cause we haven't met in person, but you seem really sweet, you're pretty, and seem to have a great personality and a good sense of humor, you also are learning to play to the piano, that's cool too

notjustanotherncguy (12/27/06  3:00:57 PM): that's cool, I  think guys are nervous about making the first move because  they think the girl might push them away and that would crush their ego and embarass them, lol

notjustanotherncguy (12/27/06  3:24:05 PM): ty
notjustanotherncguy (12/27/06  3:24:36 PM): we could always play spin the bottle, but you'd need your friends over or something for that, not fun with just 2 people, 3 is ok, 4 or more is better I guess
jensbirdss (12/27/06  3:25:06 PM): oh lol
jensbirdss (12/27/06  3:25:23 PM): how does that one work?
notjustanotherncguy (12/27/06  3:25:23 PM): otherwise we would just be kissing each other the whole time, lol
notjustanotherncguy (12/27/06  3:26:03 PM): well, we all sit in a circle and someone spins the bottle, whoever it lands on has to kiss them, or if they don't want to, sometimes you can make them do a dare or something, but they usually just kiss
jensbirdss (12/27/06  3:26:17 PM): wow lol
notjustanotherncguy (12/27/06  3:26:26 PM): you can make your own rules about what kind of kiss, how long and stuff like that
jensbirdss (12/27/06  3:26:38 PM): wat if it lands on a girl?
notjustanotherncguy (12/27/06  3:26:46 PM): that is good for me, lol haha
notjustanotherncguy (12/27/06  3:27:08 PM): well, usually the girls will have to kiss but maybe just a pec on the lips or something where they have to french kiss the guys or something
jensbirdss (12/27/06  3:27:31 PM): lol
jensbirdss (12/27/06  3:27:41 PM): wat if its 2 guys?
notjustanotherncguy (12/27/06  3:27:50 PM): good question, depends on the rules
notjustanotherncguy (12/27/06  3:28:04 PM): they might have to do a pec on the lips too or do a dare or something
jensbirdss (12/27/06  3:28:18 PM): wow kiss?
notjustanotherncguy (12/27/06  3:28:51 PM): well, that's the chance you take with the game, of course they want to kiss the girls, but you never know if it will land on another guy or not, so you take that chance so you can kiss a girl
jensbirdss (12/27/06  3:29:23 PM): oh lol
notjustanotherncguy (12/27/06  3:29:32 PM): what do you think about that game?
jensbirdss (12/27/06  3:29:43 PM): sounds kinda fun
notjustanotherncguy (12/27/06  3:29:54 PM): it's pretty cool, but you just have to have more than two people is all
jensbirdss (12/27/06  3:30:16 PM): oh
notjustanotherncguy (12/27/06  3:30:26 PM): strip poker is a lot easier with two people and the fewer people you have to get naked in front of the better, lol
jensbirdss (12/27/06  3:30:33 PM): lol
notjustanotherncguy (12/27/06  3:31:02 PM): we should try that one, but I'll let you make the rules so you're comfortable with it

notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  7:16:24 AM): here's a stupid question for you and sorry cause it's so early in the morning but, have you ever thought about sex?  like do you want to wait until you're married or just when you find the right guy or what?  just curious is all?  
jensbirdss (12/28/06  7:16:52 AM): didnt really think id wait til married
jensbirdss (12/28/06  7:16:57 AM): nobody rlly does
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  7:17:02 AM): that is very true, lol
jensbirdss (12/28/06  7:17:14 AM): kinda wondered bout it
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  7:17:15 AM): do you think you need to wait until you're older or what?
jensbirdss (12/28/06  7:17:40 AM): idk kinda been wonderin bout it
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  7:17:57 AM): who do you think you'd want to be your first?  any certain person or time?
jensbirdss (12/28/06  7:18:21 AM): i gues somebody nice
jensbirdss (12/28/06  7:18:46 AM): wen it feels rite i gues
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  7:18:57 AM): good answers, you don't want it to be with just anyone 
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  7:19:54 AM): i am just curius is all, I'm a lot older than you, but i have to say there is nothing like sex, it's awesome and being with someone for your first time who knows what they are doing and can be very gentle would be a good thing, if you really like them of course
jensbirdss (12/28/06  7:20:10 AM): that makes sense
jensbirdss (12/28/06  7:20:19 AM): heard its cool

jensbirdss (12/28/06  7:20:58 AM): that its cool
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  7:21:33 AM): sex is really only as good as the person you are with so if they were both with someone good, then they would have really liked it, if they were with someone who didn't know what he was doing, then they may not think it was all the great
jensbirdss (12/28/06  7:22:09 AM): yea sounds true
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  7:22:55 AM): well, i don't want to talk to much about it and scare you off, I'm not asking to have sex with you or anything anyway, i'm just curious about how you feel about it and all
jensbirdss (12/28/06  7:23:08 AM): its cool
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  7:23:10 AM): i didn't say that I wouldn't love to do that with you, but i'm not asking you or anything

notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  8:55:19 AM): i haven't french kissed in a while though, out of practice maybe, lol
jensbirdss (12/28/06  8:55:34 AM): u didnt?
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  8:55:55 AM): not for a while no, but I do remember how very well I believe, you can always be the judge, lol
jensbirdss (12/28/06  8:56:07 AM): k lol
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  8:57:04 AM): you know what they say though, but not that I believe it, kissing leads to touching, touching leads to more touching under the clothes, that leads to taking off the clothes, and that leads to sex, lol  like I said, not that I believe that though
jensbirdss (12/28/06  8:57:33 AM): lol
jensbirdss (12/28/06  8:57:42 AM): didnt hear that one before
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  8:57:52 AM): first for everything right? lol
jensbirdss (12/28/06  8:57:57 AM): yea lol
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  8:58:11 AM): of course, that happens more often I guess when it's the right time, and place and all
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  8:58:40 AM): i still want to buy you a matching set of bra and panties if you will still wear them for me?
jensbirdss (12/28/06  8:58:50 AM): k lol
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  8:59:00 AM): would you really though or just kind of kidding?
jensbirdss (12/28/06  9:00:13 AM): i think itd b k
jensbirdss (12/28/06  9:00:41 AM): kinda romantic to
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  9:01:32 AM): i think it could really be romantic, what would be even better is if you put them on and came out of your room and we starting kissing and all
jensbirdss (12/28/06  9:01:50 AM): wow romantic lol
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  9:02:28 AM): ok, one better, brace yourself, lol
jensbirdss (12/28/06  9:02:35 AM): lol
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  9:03:50 AM): we meet, we talk for a while, I play for you on the piaon, we hug and maybe have a quick kiss, then i give you your gift, you go to your room and undress and put the them on, just them, and then you call me, I come to your door and knock and you say come in and you're sitting on your bed in your sexy panties and bra, i sit down next to you and tell you how pretty and sexy you are and we start to kiss again
jensbirdss (12/28/06  9:04:35 AM): awwww
jensbirdss (12/28/06  9:04:41 AM): thats so romantic
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  9:04:56 AM): do you really think so?  would you be up for that?
jensbirdss (12/28/06  9:05:05 AM): it sounds sweet
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  9:05:35 AM): i think so too, it wouldn't be fair to ask you to just have on your bra and panties and me be fully dressed, would you want me to take anything off to make it fair?
jensbirdss (12/28/06  9:06:38 AM): guess it would b fairer lol
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  9:06:47 AM): so, what would you like me in?
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  9:06:57 AM): i'm a boxer guy just in case you care, lol

jensbirdss (12/28/06  9:08:10 AM): yea lol
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  9:08:44 AM): you could always put on the set I buy you and then get dressed again, we could then play strip poker until we get down to our underwear anyway, that would ad a little fun to it, lol
notjustanotherncguy (12/28/06  9:08:57 AM): have you ever seen a guy in his boxers? 
jensbirdss (12/28/06  9:09:04 AM): no lol

notjustanotherncguy (01/03/07  7:26:59 AM): hmm, well, when she says morning, she might go in at like 10 or so still though, you never know, we need to find out about when she's leaving, ask her if she wants you to cook some lunch later since she's home?  then she'll say no cause she has to go in at such and such time maybe?  try that??
