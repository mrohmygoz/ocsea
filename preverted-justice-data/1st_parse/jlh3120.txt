Let me introduce Thomas D. Campbell.  Tom says his name is John at first.  He also says that he is in his 40's - this dude is actually sixty-freakin' one at the time of these chats.  Tom is honest about one thing, however:  He has a thing for young boys.  Tom also knows that young guys = trouble.  However, as you can see, he is more than willing to give young Tony his first blowjob.  Here's Tom's chat:

Well, our time seems to be getting near.  I'm so much looking forward to getting together.  You'll probably find me the most unusual adult you've ever come in contact with.  I do have a way with young men as they do with me.  Feel free to talk about any topic you wish.  I'm completely open and honest and will help you however I can.  Please send me an email and let me know what you're curious about, what you'd like to talk about, and what you'd like to do.  Then obviously your phone number and / or address...If its the address, let me know what major intersections you're near.  I've been in the Ft Myers area 3 years but some of the side streets are unfamiliar.  I pretty much know the major streets...so any help will be appreciated.  

TTYL, 

Jon

At this point, I figured that our friend Tom here would call and then show up for his date.  However, things couldn't be quite so simple with this rocket surgeon.  We didn't hear from him as planned, so we figured that maybe he had changed his mind.  But, alas for Tom, that was not the case...

I was so much looking forward to today.  Thought you were looking forward to it also.  Called this morning...got answering device on the cell you supposedly gave me.  Then called back as agreed this afternoon...the lady answered who's phone it was...didn't know a Tony.  And you didn't write last night like I thought you would...and you said you would.  I'm sorry if I offended you..but your sure as hell hurt me.

<span class="code_c">(<i>I knew that he just must have written the number down incorrectly.  Sigh...and here I thought he had just realized that what he wanted to do with my 14-year-old persona was just sick and wrong...I guess Tom doing the right thing was just not to be.</i>)

Well, since Tom is now convicted and posted on the main page of Perverted Justice, you all know what happened next.  Tom did call, and Tom kept his date with young Tony.  I know it's been said many times, but thankfully it was me, and not a real kid, that Tom was chatting with.
