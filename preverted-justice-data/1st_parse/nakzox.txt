As I noted in the other log I posted today, we've been adding the phone verification recordings to these files lately for people to download. Davut's is certainly creepy, over three minutes of him talking to what sounds like an extraordinarily young female. He goes into the typical questions too, asking the virginity question on the phone. It's one thing to read these logs, it's another to hear the reality of these individual's intentions.
