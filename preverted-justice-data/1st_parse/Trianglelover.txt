Hey all...long time, no talk!

Well, it's not because I haven't been busy. Sometimes the wheels of justice turn a little slow...but it's so worth it. Such is the case with George A. Porter...or, as I like to call him, The Defendant. :)

Thanks to the pro-active work of Detective Lucas and theRoanoke County PD, George was arrested, and has been convicted of no less than five charges. FIVE. Incredible.

This has been very important to me, as I view George as the worst of the worst...a true groomer. From the way he talked, I have little doubt that he has done this before, and I believe that the Roanoke PD put away a very dangerous man.

Check out George's \"Conviction\" post for more info on how it all went down!

As usual, I can be reached for questions or comments at red_baroness_2004 on Yahoo Instant Messenger, or via e-mail at red_baroness_2004@yahoo.com. Thanks for reading, and it feels good to know that a very dangerous man is off the streets in Virginia, thanks to a pro-active Law Enforcement team in Roanoke, and Perverted Justice.
