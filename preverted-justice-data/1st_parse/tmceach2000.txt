Joe Public, meet Troy.  Troy, meet Joe Public.  Of course Troy has already met the fine men and women of the Kitsap County Sheriff's Department when they wrapped handcuffs around his wrists and trotted him off to jail when he tried to meet me.  Troy is very methodic about his questioning and a pattern emerges almost immediately.  He will first ask if I've EVER done anything, then upon finding out that I haven't, he will ask if I WOULD do that, establishing whether I want to and haven't had the opportunity or whether I just don't want to.  He will then move to focus the questioning further to see if I am picky about the opportunity that presents itself if I'm open to doing it.  He then brings everything full circle to focus on him.  It's rather exacting and nauseating, yet wonderfully predictable from the perspective of the contributor because it was immediately evident where his line of questioning would be going and how I could answer his questions to draw out his thinking further.  Read on, and see the most fast-moving and forward perv I've had that displeasure of busting.

hhhhgoatsrock (11/14/06  5:31:22 PM): :(
tmceach2000 (11/14/06  5:31:38 PM):  why do you think that
tmceach2000 (11/14/06  5:34:04 PM):  I don't remember if I asked you or not, but if you started having sex and your mom found out what would she do <span class="code_c">(<i>So now he starts to assess risk... Right.  Good time to do that.</i>)
tmceach2000 (11/14/06  5:34:39 PM):  I mean would you get into trouble at all
hhhhgoatsrock (11/14/06  5:35:51 PM): lol i dunno but i dont really wanna find out either lol <span class="code_c">(<i>Let's not tell mom I'm having sex, k?</i>)
hhhhgoatsrock (11/14/06  5:35:57 PM): i wont tell her 
tmceach2000 (11/14/06  5:36:04 PM):  oh I see
tmceach2000 (11/14/06  5:37:19 PM):  you should ask her if she likes to have sex a lot <span class="code_c">(<i>I have yet to find out why he keeps going back to the mom/sex thing.</i>)
hhhhgoatsrock (11/14/06  5:37:36 PM): and make her wonder why i wanna know??? omg your nuts lol
tmceach2000 (11/14/06  5:38:16 PM):  I mean, if she does maybe all 3 of us can get together and have sex <span class="code_c">(<i>UH... GROSS!!!!one!!111!!eleventy!! That has more elements of Ew to it than I can personally fathom.</i>)
hhhhgoatsrock (11/14/06  5:38:32 PM): omg are you serious? <span class="code_c">(<i>I think I displayed admirable restraint in this answer, personally.</i>)
tmceach2000 (11/14/06  5:38:46 PM):  maybe, maybe not
hhhhgoatsrock (11/14/06  5:38:51 PM): lol ok
tmceach2000 (11/14/06  5:38:54 PM):  what if I was serious
hhhhgoatsrock (11/14/06  5:39:02 PM): i dunno thats kinda strange <span class="code_c">(<i>Yet more of that restraint</i>)
tmceach2000 (11/14/06  5:39:15 PM):  why is it strange
hhhhgoatsrock (11/14/06  5:39:24 PM): i dont really wanna do that with my mom ya know? <span class="code_c">(<i>Yeah most girls don't fantasize about sleeping with their moms, as far as I can tell.</i>)
tmceach2000 (11/14/06  5:40:10 PM):  well, her and I could do it, then you and I could do it, it would be seperately not together <span class="code_c">(<i>This option doesn't sound much better, really.</i>)
hhhhgoatsrock (11/14/06  5:40:27 PM): so your using me to get to her? <span class="code_c">(<i>And the appropriate response from my character.</i>)
hhhhgoatsrock (11/14/06  5:40:31 PM): thats messed
hhhhgoatsrock (11/14/06  5:40:32 PM): :(
tmceach2000 (11/14/06  5:40:46 PM):  no, I'm using her to get to you <span class="code_c">(<i>Haven't we already established that he doesn't really need to go through the parent to get to me?  Other than the fact that she's usually out and now she's staying home a lot he has me.</i>)
hhhhgoatsrock (11/14/06  5:40:53 PM): but you dont have to
hhhhgoatsrock (11/14/06  5:40:54 PM): :(
tmceach2000 (11/14/06  5:41:18 PM):  it seems like I do because you are never free to meet for sex <span class="code_c">(<i>That's because I was trying to get my ducks in a row for what needed to happen!  Patience!!!  So eager for the handcuffs, this one was!</i>)
hhhhgoatsrock (11/14/06  5:41:22 PM): :(
tmceach2000 (11/14/06  5:43:52 PM):  I'm just getting kinda frustrated that's all <span class="code_c">(<i>Can you HEAR the temper tantrum he's throwing?  \"I wanna get arrested and you're keeping me from getting arrested!  Dangit!</i>)
hhhhgoatsrock (11/14/06  5:43:58 PM): i know im sorry :(
hhhhgoatsrock (11/14/06  5:45:39 PM): i still wanna meet you tho
tmceach2000 (11/14/06  5:46:34 PM):  if that's true, then you should try using your mom so that we can meet for sex <span class="code_c">(<i>That's a new variation on \"If you loved me you would.</i>)
hhhhgoatsrock (11/14/06  5:46:54 PM): i dont wanna talk about this with my mom shes gonna ask a bunch of questions
tmceach2000 (11/14/06  5:48:38 PM):  then I dunno how we will ever meet

As you can see, he wanted NOTHING more than to meet my child persona for sex.  He was eager and pushy.  All his questions were pointed and calculated to determine the chances for meeting me for sex.  He would fall definitively into the category of \"Fast Mover\" rather than \"Groomer.\"  I, for one, am glad to see the Troy Shannon McEachern will be dealing with the consequences of his choices for 15 months of state prison and another 3-4 years of probation along with 15 years of Sex Offender registration.
