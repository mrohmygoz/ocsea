Meet Social Studies teacher Scott Brown.  Scott began interaction with my 14 year old character New Years Eve.  During our on going conversations, the diligent crew here at PJ positively identified my predator and we put together a neat package for the Cincinnati Police.  

Due to the content of my conversations with Scott, the Cincinnati Police immediately suspected they would find child pornography on Scott's computer.  Low and behold, they scored!

Scott was scheduled to face a Grand Jury on the 18th.  As more information becomes available it will be posted in our Media Forum.

At this point in time, because of extenuating circumstances, the screen name and name of my character are being withheld.

I would like to thank the CEO of the Great Oaks School District, The City of Sharonville Police Department, and the Cincinnati Police for their swift and dedicated action.

ProtegeES2002 [9:23 P.M.]:  wow, very interesting 
Profile 14 [9:23 P.M.]:  shes mean
ProtegeES2002 [9:23 P.M.]:  yeah, sounds like it 
ProtegeES2002 [9:24 P.M.]:  well she is not really right about me, cuae I told you I would help you out and didn't expect anything from you
Profile 14 [9:24 P.M.]:  is just her
ProtegeES2002 [9:24 P.M.]:  oh well 
Profile 14 [9:24 P.M.]:  she gets pissed when I get good tests and now she is pissed a dude wants to help me
ProtegeES2002 [9:25 P.M.]:  well I kinda expected her to not be ok with it, so I am not surprised 
Profile 14 [9:25 P.M.]:  what I do now?
ProtegeES2002 [9:25 P.M.]:  I dont' know 
ProtegeES2002 [9:26 P.M.]:  all you can do is if she starts trying to make you do guys for money is turn her in 
Profile 14 [9:26 P.M.]:  she just says that
Profile 14 [9:27 P.M.]:  I want to bring the drug shyt up but really need that if I do i can run
ProtegeES2002 [9:27 P.M.]:  well you never know 
ProtegeES2002 [9:27 P.M.]:  what do you mean   \" but really need that if I do i can fun\"? 
Profile 14 [9:27 P.M.]:  run
Profile 14 [9:27 P.M.]:  leave
ProtegeES2002 [9:27 P.M.]:  yeah 
ProtegeES2002 [9:28 P.M.]:  thing is if you run away you can't finish your schooling at a school here, cause you will have no records  
Profile 14 [9:28 P.M.]:  can you make her freak&gt;?
ProtegeES2002 [9:29 P.M.]:  what do you mean? 
Profile 14 [9:29 P.M.]:  like say you are gonna turn her in
ProtegeES2002 [9:29 P.M.]:  problem is if I do that to her, she can turn around and say to me that she will turn me in also 
Profile 14 [9:30 P.M.]:  for what?  you don't do drugs
ProtegeES2002 [9:30 P.M.]:  no, but for trying to get a underage boy off the net to move in with me is what she would say 
Profile 14 [9:30 P.M.]:  i told her you were my old teacher and I told you stuff
ProtegeES2002 [9:31 P.M.]:  well she already thinks its more then that, which is why she called me a perv, and made the comment about you bing into that stuff and making money off of you, so in her mind it is a gay guy wanting you to move in wiht him, that is what she would say to the police 
Profile 14 [9:32 P.M.]:  no she just wants me to think no one likes me
ProtegeES2002 [9:32 P.M.]:  well why don't you just tell her you are going to turn her in? 
Profile 14 [9:33 P.M.]:  cause i will be dead
ProtegeES2002 [9:33 P.M.]:  she is not going to kill you 
Profile 14 [9:33 P.M.]:  you are white bread

Profile 14 [9:34 P.M.]:  you never been in the ring 
ProtegeES2002 [9:34 P.M.]:  well it will be no better then for me, if I say that to her her guys will track me down and kill me 
Profile 14 [9:35 P.M.]:  they hate me cuase I wont sell at school
Profile 14 [9:35 P.M.]:  or use
ProtegeES2002 [9:35 P.M.]:  well I'm not sure what our options are 
ProtegeES2002 [9:35 P.M.]:  if you run away you can't go to school, you would have to wait till your older and get your GED and then go to college 
Profile 14 [9:36 P.M.]:  why cant we just be boyfirends
ProtegeES2002 [9:36 P.M.]:  well we could, but I thought you really took your education seriously, and wanted to finish school 
Profile 14 [9:37 P.M.]:  i do
ProtegeES2002 [9:38 P.M.]:  well w/o it being legal, you can't go to school down here, there would be no way to enroll you............plus if people, my freinds, and family knew you were here, they would question who you are, why you are not in school at all. I would basically have to hide you in my apt and not take you around my freinds and family 
Profile 14 [9:38 P.M.]:  thats what i got now
ProtegeES2002 [9:38 P.M.]:  no, you are in school and getting your education 
ProtegeES2002 [9:39 P.M.]:  and you have friends and can anywhere and not have ot worry about someone asking you who you are and all 
Profile 14 [9:39 P.M.]:  okk
ProtegeES2002 [9:40 P.M.]:  I'm just saying, if you run away and come down here, you can't enroll in school, and we would have to keep you a big secret. not saying you couldn't go out, but we would have to be careful 
Profile 14 [9:40 P.M.]:  will you talk to her
ProtegeES2002 [9:41 P.M.]:  I dont' know what you want me to say to her, she is only gong to accuse me of being a pervert and all 
Profile 14 [9:42 P.M.]:  she likes me to feel bad
ProtegeES2002 [9:42 P.M.]:  well I understand that 
Profile 14 [9:45 P.M.]:  can i make her call you so you can make her think it is real and you will pay her?
ProtegeES2002 [9:46 P.M.]:  well several problems she is going to ask me questions I wont' know.............like your last name, the school you went to, grade I tought you in and ohter things that culd trip me up 
ProtegeES2002 [9:46 P.M.]:  let me think and see if I can come up with something 
Profile 14 [9:46 P.M.]:  she don't know where i go now
Profile 14 [9:46 P.M.]:  never went to parent stuff
ProtegeES2002 [9:47 P.M.]:  I need to think  
Profile 14 [9:47 P.M.]:  when they moved me to the academy i had to have her sign so I just did it
ProtegeES2002 [9:48 P.M.]:  like I said, I need to think
