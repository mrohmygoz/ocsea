greeneyed121 (7:17:56 PM): I will gently cup and massage your soft breasts, kiss them and run my tongue along them
greeneyed121 (7:18:58 PM): I will gently flick the nipples with my tongue, and massage them till you moan
katiedidsings (7:19:39 PM): wow
katiedidsings (7:19:49 PM): no 1 ever treated me dat nise
greeneyed121 (7:20:06 PM): My hands will travel down your smooth body, till we reach your pants. Here we will remove your pants and underwear, revealing your beautiful nude body
greeneyed121 (7:21:13 PM): Here I will make you sit and spread your legs apart. Then I will kneel between your legs and bring my face close to your clit.
katiedidsings (7:22:26 PM): dat sound soooo nise
greeneyed121 (7:22:29 PM): My hot breath washes over your skin, causing goose bumps. I gently kiss between your legs and give it a long, slow lick that shoots fire up your body
greeneyed121 (7:23:51 PM): Your clit leaks juice between your legs and I begin to slowly, but constantly, lick it, kiss it, even nibble gently. The nibbles cause you to jerk and moan
katiedidsings (7:24:24 PM): wow
greeneyed121 (7:26:06 PM): Then I take my finger and slowly insert it into your clit. You moan and jerk a little, but you are so tight, hot and wet on the inside! I gently and slowly remove my finger and then ram it back in. Slowly, my rhythem increases, and you moan and jerk as waves of pleasure pulsate through your body
katiedidsings (7:26:52 PM): wow
greeneyed121 (7:27:37 PM): Finally you come, your first orgasm of the evening. You are tired and a little spent, but I spread your legs again and prepare to thrust my eager cock between your legs
greeneyed121 (7:28:28 PM): As I begin to enter you, the heat and tightness of your clit seeks to overwhelm me. It is pure heaven once I am completely inside you
katiedidsings (7:29:05 PM): omg
greeneyed121 (7:30:12 PM): You moan again now that I am inside you. Like I did with the finger, I begin to pump slowly in and out, my tempo steadily increasing. You moans have become one long drawn out sound, insterspurrsed with the need to breath
katiedidsings (7:31:17 PM): k i m exsitd
greeneyed121 (7:31:46 PM): Having already come you begin to reach your climax more quickly. I have become lost in the pleasures of your clit, myself nearing orgasm. Finally we come, together, crying out in unison.
katiedidsings (7:32:23 PM): wow
greeneyed121 (7:33:12 PM): We then collapse into each others, holding our sweating bodies close. We will then regain our strength, taking pleasure in the closeness of the other
katiedidsings (7:33:57 PM): u r a good riter
greeneyed121 (7:34:04 PM): Then you can show me how experienced you are in oral sex
