Verifier's note: I called and asked for Phil. The woman who answered the phone asked someone else to \"Go up and tell Phil someone is on the phone for him.\" Phil told me he was watching TV and waiting to see if any Jason movies were going to be on because the date was Friday the 13th. There were several long silences and I asked him if he'd be online the following day. He said he probably would, and I hung up.
